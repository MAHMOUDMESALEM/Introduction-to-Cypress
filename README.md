## Getting Started

To get started with Cypress, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
https://github.com/MAHMOUDMESALEM/Introduction-to-Cypress

2. Install the dependencies by navigating to the project's root directory and running:

         npm install

 3. Launch the Cypress Test Runner by running:

         npm run cy:open

 This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run tests. The sample tests provided in the repository can be found in the `cypress/integration` directory.

4. To run the tests in headless mode (without the Test Runner UI), use the following command:

         npm run cy:run

This will execute the tests in the terminal or command prompt.

For more information on Cypress installation and configuration, refer to the official [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html).

## Examples

The `examples` directory in this repository contains a variety of sample tests to help you understand and explore different features of Cypress. Each example is accompanied by detailed comments explaining the purpose and usage of the code.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the examples to suit your testing needs. You can run the examples using the Cypress Test Runner or run them in headless mode using the `npm run cy:run` command.
